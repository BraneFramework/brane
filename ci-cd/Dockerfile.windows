# Simple Windows-based wrapper around the scripts in this directory that we can
# use to emulate the GitHub actions locally.
# 
# Note: this is a Windows container, which generally sucks. This means:
# - Run this container in a Windows host
# - Don't use BuildX, but the default build system (since BuildX only supports Linux containers)
# - You might need to change images if you're running from another Windows version/Windows Server instead of the consumer OS.
