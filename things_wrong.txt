DOCUMENTATION

 - Missing how to connect to Jupyter Notebook/Lab

 - Missing how to connect to the /data partition from the outside



ERROR HANDLING

 - Fix error verbosity in brane-cli
    - Mostly files loading; completely unobvious why some in-yaml files aren't found (i.e., that they are that file)
       - Already did a bit on obvious loads

 - Fix errors in BraneScript VM
    - Right now it just generates a crash report with no explanation whatsoever
    - Either catch some language errors more up the tree (while compiling), or fix the VM to be more verbose

 - Job executor doesn't seem to tell driver when it crashes

 - Fix registry.txt not found when trying to publish package
    - Turn out you had to `brane login` first
    - But need to be more verbose about that



USER EXPERIENCE

 - When removing package allow a version to be specified
    - Already changed in brane-cli



CODE

 - brane-drv does not handle failed job
    - 

 - brane-bvm::vm keeps failing at removing a correlation ID from the result
    - Causes the vm to crash, which is no bueno
    - It's when no value is returned from job; created small alternative codepath for now

 - brane-bvm did not properly propagate array type
    - Fixed by manually adding a function that resolves the type using child types

 - brane-job can't start container with "network kind not found"
    - Changed network name in infra.yml to 'brane'

 - Next, Brane job crashes while scheduling remote command due to unknown host 'https://registry:5000"
    - That's because we do relative to actualy docker host so that _is_ 127.0.0.1

 - Brane job crashes while scheduling remote command due to double 'registry:5000' http URL
    - Fixed by removing that part in brane-job but keeping it in brane-plr

 - Package repository not constant in between docker resets?
    - This might actually make sense, as we keep restoring the docker image every start-instance
    - Should probably definitely be fixed, though, since a brane update would mean a destruction of the repository
    - Or this is desired behaviour; hmmmmm...

 - Fix VM quitting silently when import not found?
    - Might also be due to remote session, but anyway, the prompt is nice.

 - Fix the driver container (and possibly more) not able to access other containers via '127.0.0.1'
    - Instead, we pass the hostname in docker compose in an environment variable

 - Added names for standard instance brane containers

 - Fix error that wouldn't allow the first tutorial to work (the one with replacing paths)
    - Did that by replacing the brackets by already-encoded %7B and %7D in the replace string

 - Fix '/health' not working in API
    - Added custom path to warp for that

 - Fix compilation with clamp
    - Now: first have to add the derive part of the package, then it doesn't find the env macro
    - Fixed by using structopt instead, which is a kind of precursor to clamp the way it's used
