# DOCKERFILE.dev for BRANE
#   by Tim MÃ¼ller and Onno Valkering
#
# Contains the Dockerfile for the various Brane instance images.
#
# This version builds the development images, which prefer build speed and
# debugging over fast executables by simply copying pre-build executables from
# the project 'target' directory.
# 
# This results in much faster build times when building repeatedly, due to the
# build cache being re-used, and (on virtualized Docker environments) much
# faster disk I/O times.
# 
# For a release version, see Dockerfile.rls.
#
