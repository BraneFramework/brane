# DOCKERFILE.bld for BRANE

# This file creates a build image, which we may use to build RUST musl targets.
# 
# They will be written to the './target/containers' file (as the Cargo target).
#

# Use the RUST image as base
FROM rust:1

# Install build dependencies (that are not in the rust image already)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    cmake \
    musl-tools \
    build-essential \
 && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Make symlinks
RUN ln -s /usr/bin/musl-gcc /usr/bin/musl-g++

# Fetch the target(s)
RUN rustup target add "x86_64-unknown-linux-musl"
RUN rustup target add "aarch64-unknown-linux-musl"

# Prepare the linked directory
RUN mkdir /build

# Copy the build script
COPY ./contrib/scripts/container-build.sh /build.sh
RUN chmod +x /build.sh

# Run the command with whatever we specify in the `docker run`
ENTRYPOINT [ "/build.sh" ]
