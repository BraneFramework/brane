# Changelog

All notable changes to the Brane framework will be documented in this file.

## [4.0.0] - TODO
This update sees a lot of changes. Most notably, it integrated with the [policy reasoner effort](https://github.com/epi-project/policy-reasoner) (see issue [#60](https://github.com/epi-project/brane/issues/60)).

### Added
- Attributes to BraneScript (e.g., `#[tag("amy.foo")]` or `#![on("foo")]`).
- The `branectl wizard` subcommand, which interactively goes through the steps of setting up a node.
- Commands for cross-compiling to macOS x86-64 _and_ ARM 64-bit from Linux :)
- `branec --trace` flag to enable trace-level debugging.
  - Accordingly, some `trace`-log prints have been added to the compiler in `brane-ast`.
- The data analysis performed in `brane-ast` to also annotate function calls with possible data inputs (relevant for `commit_result` builtin).
  - Return-statements on workflow level are also annotated.
- `TEST_LOGGER` and `TEST_FILES` environment variables to any unit tests using `brane_shr::utilities::test_on_dsl_files*`.
  - If you give `TEST_LOGGER=1` or `TEST_LOGGER=true`, then it instantiates a `log`-capable logger ([humanlog](https://github.com/Lut99/humanlog-rs)).
  - If you give `TEST_FILES=<file1>[,<file2>[...]]`, then only the given files are tested instead of all in the `tests` folder. The files are matched by name, and then specifically an `end_of()`-call.
- Integration with the [policy reasoner effort](https://github.com/epi-project/policy-reasoner):
  - Part of this is:
    - Adding `brane check` to validate workflow against all checkers without running anything.
      - Note, this is currently imperfect, as checkers answer questions with pre-workflow state. This means that they may assume they won't have a dataset, while they would have while executing the workflow as a result of a previous step. To fix, needs some kind of hypothetical state specification to either `brane-api` or the `policy-reasoner`.
    - Adding `branectl generate policy_db` to initialize the policy database file.
    - Adding `branectl generate policy_secret` to initialize a JWK set to use for API endpoint authentication in the policy reasoner.
    - Adding `branectl generate policy_token` to initialize a JWT based on the given JWK set.
    - Adding `branectl policy add` to push policies to the checker.
    - Adding `branectl policy activate` to activate policies on the checker.
    - Adding `user`-field to `InstanceInfo`, accompanied with a `--user` option when creating new instance in `brane` (\[**breaking change**\], regeneration of instances necessary).
    - Changing Docker Compose files used by `branectl` (\[**breaking change**\] if you use customized ones).
    - Changing `policies` path in `node.yml` to `policy_database` file \[**breaking change**\].
    - Changing `brane-job` to ask permission to ask a task from the `brane-chk` service.
    - Changing `brane-reg` to ask permission to ask a task from the `brane-chk` service.
    - Changing the `checker` service entry in `node.yml` to a private service instead of a public service (not a breaking change, since this now simply ignores the `external_address`-field if any).
    - Changing Brane services to communicate use-case identifiers instead of addresses of central registries.
    - Changing a worker's `node.yml` to map use-case identifiers to central registries (`brane-api`) (see the `usecases`-field) \[**breaking change**\].
    - Removing `branectl generate policies` as the old file is no longer used \[**breaking change**\].
- Graceful shutdown for instance services (`brane-api`, `brane-drv`, `brane-job`, `brane-plr`, `brane-reg`).
- Passing the `--debug` flag is now the default to the builtin `docker-compose-*.yml` files in `branectl`. If you want to revert to default behaviour, extract the compose file(s) first (`branectl extract compose ...`), change it accordingly, and then pass it during lifetime commands (e.g., `branectl start -f path/to/compose/file ...`).
- Minimum Rust versions to all `Cargo.toml` files ([#86](https://github.com/epi-project/brane/pull/86)).

### Changed
- The WIR no longer has a dynamic definition table, but simply a large table spanning all scopes.
  - To do this, the interface between the driver and planner have been updated (not a breaking change since inter-service communication with different service versions is not assumed).
- `branec` now uses [humanlog](https://github.com/Lut99/humanlog-rs) as logging backend for nicer messages.
- `brane-drv` and `brane-plr` are now using Rust 2021 instead of Rust 2018.
- BraneScript syntax to remove the `on`-structs, and instead using `on`-, `loc`- or `location`-attributes \[**breaking change**\].
- More error prints to use a trace (i.e., `Error::source()`) rather than endless colons.
- `brane-drv` and `brane-plr` to communicate using HTTP instead of Kafka, finally. This allows us to finally get rid of `aux-kafka` and `aux-zookeeper` \[**breaking change**\].
- `branectl` now embeds `cfssl`/`cfssljson` binaries, either downloaded or compiled from source at compile time. The latter because 1.6.3 does not include ARM binaries by default.
- Now relying on `serde_yml` instead of `serde_yaml` because the latter is no longer maintained ([#84](https://github.com/epi-project/brane/pull/84)).

### Fixed
- The BraneScript compiler hanging in an infinite loop in some cases.
  - Specifically, it might fail if it is parsing a non-`[` unary operator.
- The BraneScript compiler panicking on successive projections.
- CI/CD in the repository by moving most of it to scripts which we _can_ test offline.
- The WIR using platform-specific `usize::MAX` to detect the main function. This has been replaced with `FunctionId` (`brane-ast`) and `ProgramCounter` (`brane-exe`) \[**breaking change**\].
- `make.py` relying on buildx being the default Docker builder.
- `make.py` reporting wrong names in `make.py --targets` for `*-image-build` targets ([#78](https://github.com/epi-project/brane/pull/78)).
- `brane instance edit` accidentally appending `info.yml` twice ([#73](https://github.com/epi-project/brane/pull/73)).
- Various examples not running (see [#76](https://github.com/epi-project/brane/pull/76)).
- `cargo clippy`-warnings.
- `Cargo.toml` not committing to patch-level minimum versions ([#92](https://github.com/epi-project/brane/pull/92)). Extra thanks to @DanielVoogsgerd for this one.
- `specifications` not correctly setting the `rc` feature-flag for `serde` ([#90](https://github.com/epi-project/brane/pull/90)).

## [3.0.0] - 2023-10-22
### Added
- The `libbrane_cli.so` library (`brane-cli-c` crate), which provides C-bindings to the client functionality of the `brane` CLI tool. This can be used by other projects (e.g., [Brane IDE](https://github.com/epi-project/brane-ide)) to provide client functionality when written in C/C++.
- The `branectl upgrade` subcommand, which can be used to upgrade old backend-facing config files to the new style.
  - Added support for `node.yml` files
- The `brane upgrade` subcommand, which can be used to upgrade old user-facing config files to the new style.
  - Added support for `data.yml` files
- An extensive description of the `brane-prx` service in the generated docs.
- The `--keep-containers` options to `brane run`, `brane repl` and `brane test` to keep containers around for debugging after running.
- A garbage collector to `brane-drv` for running sessions, to terminate them if they haven't been accessed for over 24 hours.
- An `overview`-crate acting as a proper entrypoint to auto-generated docs.
  - This overview includes a proper crate overview.
- `brane import` now has a `--branch` flag to import a package on the non-`main` branch instead \[**breaking change**\].
  - This is breaking because it used to be the _default_ branch instead of the `main`-branch.

### Changed
- The `backend.yml` and `data.yml` files to use the default tagging option in serde (i.e., use `!<variant>` instead of the `kind`-field) \[**breaking change**\].
- The `node.yml` file to accept `delegate` as an alias for `job` instead of `driver` \[**breaking change**\].
- Bumped `brane-tsk` packages to newest version (base64).
- No longer depending on git2 in any fashion.

### Fixed
- Lots of `clippy` errors.
<!-- - Kubernetes backend support (it used to work, got broken in 1.0.0+)
  - To do so, `branelet` has added the `ENABLE_STDOUT_PREFIX` environment variable to allow the Kubernetes engine to distinguish between actual output and logging. As a consequence, all packages have to be rebuilt, which is a [**breaking change**]. -->

## [2.0.0] - 2023-02-27
### Added
- Profiling reports to (parts of) the framework. These can be used to examine the framework's performance from a development perspective.
- `--profile-dir` to `branectl` that can be used to collect all profile results into one directory.
- `branectl` accepting the `exe`-option on the `start` and `stop` subcommands, which can be used to change the Docker compose executable called.
- Support for generating certificates in `branectl` with the `generate certs`-subcommand.
  - _technically_ this is a breaking change because we changes the location of the command from toplevel to be nested under `generate`, but since it was not implemented we don't mark it as such.
- The `--trace` flag to `branectl` that unlocks even more detailled logs.
- Support for compiling `branectl` containerized, to meet `GLIBC` requirements.
- The Docker Compose-files (`docker-compose-central.yml` and `docker-compose-worker.yml`) as baked-in files to `branectl`.
- `brane-prx` being able to proxy traffic through a SOCKS5 proxy.
  - To do this, the `proxy`-field in `node.yml` has a different syntax to select the target protocol [**breaking change**].
  - `branectl` has also been updated to reflect this.
- Windows support for `make.py`.
- Windows support for the `brane` CLI.
- The `--local-aux` option to `branectl` such that it becomes easier to use pre-downloaded auxillary images.
- Docker Buildx cache mounts (`--mount=type=cache`) to the compilation step, which should massively increase speed of repeated release builds.
- Automatic CRLF detection when adding UTF-8/ASCII files to a container, and a subsequent prompt to deal with it.
- The `--crlf-ok` flag to indicate no prompt is necessary when encountering CRLF files.
- `postinstall`, `post-install` and `post_install` as aliases for `unpack` in `container.yml`.

### Changed
- Protobuf descriptions to be in pure Rust instead of `.proto` files. This should allow use to re-use Rust structs in a more ergonimic style, as well as get rid of the very annoying `protoc` dependency.
- `brane login` to be more like a keymanager instead. Check `brane instance` and `brane certs` instead, and consult the [wiki](https://wiki.enablingpersonalizedinterventions.nl/user-guide) for how to use this new system [**breaking change**].
- The `--debug` flag in the `brane-cli` can now be used from all nested subcommands.
- Various option and flags (`--debug`, `-n`/`--node-config`, `-e`/`--exe`, `-f`/`--file`) to be able to be used in subcommands as well in `branectl`.
- `branectl` to default to `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose` as compose executable [**breaking change**].
- `branectl` using the friendlier, in-house [humanlog](https://github.com/Lut99/humanlog-rs) logger instead of [env_logger](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/).
- `make.py` to move the download capabilities to `branectl`, allowing for a friendlier (and easier) interface.
- `aux-xenon` to be an image in the Brane release tar (central node).
- The general layout of `node.yml` to be more sensible (it focusses on services rather than names, ports, etc) [**breaking change**]
- The `socksx` dependency to use [our own fork](https://github.com/epi-project/socksx) instead of [Onno's repository](https://github.com/onnovalkering/socksx) to achieve Windows compatibility for the `brane` CLI (see above).
- `main.py`'s output directory for `aux-xenon` now respects the build mode (i.e., release or `--dev`).
- The `-m`/`--mode` option in `branectl` to `--image-dir`, for a more sensible interface.
- `--version` to be come a positional parameter in `brane test` [**breaking change**]
- `--show-result` to have `-r` as short flag instead of `-s` [**breaking change**]
- The 'active instance link' to be a regular file containing the name of the instance instead of a softlink (because Windows does not give default symbolic link permissions :/)

### Fixed
- The previous version not making it through the tests.
- `brane build` not working when a file was nested from the root.

## [1.0.0] - 2023-01-06
**IMPORTANT NOTICE**: From now on, the framework will stick to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). Because we are still in development, however, we will consider any API-breaking change to be any change relating to the _usage_ of the program, not to any Rust-API the library provides. However, that will likely change once the framework is more mature.

This release basically sees the release of an entirely rebuilt framework. Expect to find bugs and change how you worked with it (especially as administrator).

### Added
- Extra example code that implements more advanced filesystem features, which may be used to inspect the shared `/data` partition at runtime.
- `branectl` binary (as the `brane-ctl` crate) as a `brane` counterpart to servers. This takes over starting and stopping nodes from the `make.py` script as well, meaning it no longer offers `start-instance` (see below).
- `node.yml` file as a "node config file", that defines IP addresses, necessary paths, the kind, w/e of a single node's environment.
- `brane data ...` subcommand to manage local datasets.
- `brane-ast` crate, which provides compiler methods for transforming the BraneScript/Bakery AST to the workflow representation (see below).
- `brane-exe` crate, which replaces `brane-bvm` to execute the workflow representation (see below).
- `brane-tsk` crate, which collects much of the logic in `brane-plr` and `brane-job` into a new crate that builds upon `brane-exe` to execute tasks on either offline or distributed backends (see below).
- `brane-reg` service, that is a domain-local registry of datasets (and, in the future, packages).
- `brane-prx` service, which is a service that acts as a relay in front of all inter-domain traffic to enable proxying through bridging functions and whatnot.
- _Policies_, which, although hardcoded, restricted who may do what with which datasets. Currently, policies are present in `brane-reg` and `brane-job` as simple hardcoded rules. This requires TLS for data transfers (see below).
- TLS to data transfers. This means that setting up a domain is now marginally more complex, since certificates have to be generated.
- `unpack` as a new section in `container.yml` files, which replaces the semantics of the old `install` section (see below).
- `contrib/scripts/create_certs.sh` to generate scripts in the format that Brane wants.
- Lots of BraneScript example/test files, which may be useful for understanding the language. Check `tests/branescript`.
- A way of compiling the scripts to a workflow file offline with the new `branec` executable.
- The option to defer initialization of a variable in BraneScript using the `null` value.

### Changed
- The way that scripts are compiled. Instead of bytecode, the system now compiles to so-called Workflows, which is like bytecode but ordered in such a way that control flow information is preserved.
- The way data is handled. Instead of a shared filesystem, there are now specialized `Data` structs that live on a certain domain and are automatically transferred. There are also `IntermediateResults` that represent results within a workflow.
- `make.sh` into `make.py`, which is completely re-designed to be more managable and complex (especially w.r.t. deciding if recompilation is necessary or not).
- `brane push`, `brane pull` and `brane remove` to accept multiple packages to push, pull or remove respectively.
- `specifications::version::Version` to be able to parse a given `<name>:<version>` pair (which will likely be the default way of entering versions from now on).
- `docker-compose-*.yml` and `make.py` to make an explicit difference between a centralized, general control node and a domain-local worker node.
- `brane-api` now needs to have knowledge about the infrastructure too (i.e., be provided with the `infra.yml` file).
- `brane-job` to now explicitly live on a domain instead of the central node.
- the semantics of the `install` section in `container.yml` files: now, the commands are processed _before_ the workspace is copied over instead of after in order to be much nicer to Docker caching. To emulate the old behaviour, use the new `unpack` section (see above).
- Bumped `clap` to `4.0.25`.

### Fixed
- `brane-api` not accepting 'latest' when pulling packages
- The `brane` CLI failing to run a pulled package.
- Keywords in BraneScript being parsed as such when part of an identifier (i.e., 'new_a' would error because of 'new').
- Lockfiles not always being removed during builds (especially things like interruptions).
- Other BraneScript issues, including but not limited to:
  - Fixing data- and result analysis w.r.t. loops

### Known bugs
- [[#27](https://github.com/epi-project/brane/issues/27)] The framework cannot currently connect to domains that are accessed by IP instead of hostname (resulting in TLS errors; check [this issue](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest/issues/1328)). As a workaround, use the `Hostnames` option in `node.yml` to provide hostnames for a set of IP addresses and use those instead.
- [[#28](https://github.com/epi-project/brane/issues/28)] The REPL is quite buggy as well, often not properly carrying information between two statements. For now, as a workaround, put the loose statements in a single line to keep the information consistent.
- [[#29](https://github.com/epi-project/brane/issues/29)] Data transfer pre-task execution is unreasonably slow, making the framework effectively unusable for use-cases which rely on iteration in BraneScript.

## [0.6.3] - 2022-05-31
### Added
- Tests for various opcodes in the VM. More will follow in due time.
- `brane run` can now run from stdin by passing `-` as filename.

### Changed
- JuiceFS is now downloaded again instead of being compiled for packages & `once-format`.
- `make.sh` now expects releases to put `brane` instance services into an archive.

### Fixed
- Comparisons being the other way around (i.e., `1 < 2` returned `false` and `1 > 2` returned `true`).
- Comparing two strings with the same value (but different strings) still returning false.
- Running any for-loop causing the next statement to fail with 'VM not in a state to accept main function.'
- Any erronous statement causing the next statement to fail with 'VM not in a state to accept main function.'
- Some arrays crashing the VM with 'Could not resolve type of Array', even though it was a valid Array.

## [0.6.2] - 2022-05-23
### Added
- Better documentation to the `hello_world` example.
- `base64` tutorial code (for the [documentation](https://wiki.enablingpersonalizedinterventions.nl/user-guide/software-engineers/base64.html))
- `filesystem` tutorial code (for the [documentation](https://wiki.enablingpersonalizedinterventions.nl/user-guide/software-engineers/filesystem.html))
- `github` tutorial code (for the [documentation](https://wiki.enablingpersonalizedinterventions.nl/user-guide/software-engineers/github.html))
- Support to compile packages for different architectures than the current host using the `--arch` flag. Check the documentation to learn more about dependencies.
  - Note: cross-compilation does not yet work on M1 macs (due to the [multi-arch image](https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static) [not supporting non-x86_64 hosts](https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static#supported-host-architectures))
- Support to compile the framework for different architectures using the `--arch` flag in `make.sh`. Check the documentation to learn more about dependencies.
  - Note: cross-compilation does not yet work on M1 macs (due to the [multi-arch image](https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static) [not supporting non-x86_64 hosts](https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static#supported-host-architectures))
- Support for building the images using pre-compiled binaries, either downloaded from Github or by manually supplying them.

### Changed
- From now on, much more binaries will be tied to each release which the `make.sh` script may download.

### Fixed
- Shared Redis filesystem not working on Kubernetes clusters due to wrong URLs being passed in the `once-format` job.
- clippy failing again.

## [0.6.1] - 2022-05-13
### Added
- The code of the "Hello, world!" example in the documentation.

### Changed
- `brane-drv`, `brane-job` and `brane-plr` services to accept `infra.yml` and `secrets.yml` via a shared folder again.
- `brane test` no longer printing useless 'Please provide input for the chosen function' statement if the function has no inputs.
- The `kube` dependencies in `brane-job` to be pushed to `0.72`, and bumping Kube API version to 1.23.

### Fixed
- An issue with the `brane-cli` dependency checker where it would fail if it cannot read the Docker Buildx version. This is now patched to be a) slightly more free in what it can parse, and b) not error anymore when it sees an invalid version number but throw a warning instead.

## [0.6.0] - 2022-05-08
### Added
- Garbage collection to custom Heap backend.
- `version` command to brane-cli.
- '/version/ path to Brane-API, to query instance version (which is what `brane version` does if logged-in).
- Script to automatically* generate Kubernetes deployment files.
  - *It still requires a few adaptations to make it work, and only works on Linux (not macOS).
- Possibility to deploy the control plane on a Kubernetes cluster.

### Changed
- Branelet, brane-drv, brane-clb and brane-job to allow for much more feedback to reported to the user (when the job returns non-zero exit codes, when branelet fails to launch, ...).
- Opcodes to be an enum, allowing more streamlined conversion to names and changing opcode numbers.
- The 'build' and 'import' subcommands to be much more verbose in errors (especially in referenced files in container.yml).
- The 'build' and 'import' to use '--workdir' instead of '--context', also changing its behaviour to a more intuitive version.
- The organisation of utils.rs in brane-cli (includes commonly used functions from package.rs + its own error enum).
- The Makefile to a Bash script (`./make.sh`) with much of the same functionality, except that is has better rebuild checking and CLI support.
- Code structure of bytecode.rs, frames.rs, objects.rs and stack.rs in brane-bvm.
- Handles in the Heap backend completely, so they can now be used without being passed a Heap object.
- The PackageInfo / ContainerInfo files to now have OpenAPI document / ContainerInfo as user interface, PackageInfo as general backend metadata and LocalContainerInfo as image-local file for branelet.
- The brane-cli directory utilities to not automatically create directories anymore (we have separate functions for that now).
- Some crates to use clap again, as we finally found the issue (missing 'env' feature).
- Merged `docker-compose-svc.yml` and `docker-compose-brn.yml` into one file to properly express dependencies.
- Changed location of some in-container build scripts to `contrib/scripts/`.
- The compilation process to have more overview and achieve better build speeds (especially for release builds).
- Various default service ports to more obscure and (hopefully) unused ones (e.g., registry now has port `50050` instead of `5000`).

### Fixed
- Tests not compiling.
- OP_PARALLEL being disabled; it's now working again as expected.
- The Brane executable making files instead of directories when making standard config directories.
- Docker not refreshing images with the same version after building them or pushing them.
- brane-job not passing the 'debug' flag to branelet.
- small issues that prevented [brane-ide](https://github.com/epi-project/brane) from working.
- brane-drv crashing when receiving out-of-order status update messages.
- `kube` location kind, so it's now working and tested again.

## [0.5.0] - 2022-02-10
### Added
- '/health' path in brane-api to follow tutorial more closely.
- Names for Brane service containers to allow more easy interaction.
- A lot of additional error catching and reporting across the entire project (but still a lot to do).
- VM now properly returning internal errors to the user (when running either locally or remotely).

### Changed
- The project is now being worked on by a new owner (Tim, pleased to meet you).
- Version can now be omitted when pushing, defaulting to the latest version instead.
- Version can now be specified more intuitively when removing a package.
- Streamlined naming of 'ecu' packages; all naming of them as 'code' has been changed to 'ecu'.
- Compiling Brane for development purposes. It's now possible to cross-compile locally on a shared Docker partition (saving a lot of time on macOS), meaning that it doesn't have to rebuild from scratch every time the containers are launched.
- Brane-bvm's heap backend to a custom one, because the old one did not play well with threads and parallelism.
- OP_PARALLEL to be temporarily disabled due to new heap.

### Fixed
- Clamp not compiling anymore; using StructOpt in most cases instead
- Branelet not being able to run OpenAPI package properly due to incorrectly replacing URL values (expected '{' and '}', but actually got '%7B' and '%7D').
- Containers not being able to reach each other due to incorrect IPs (most assumed '127.0.0.1', but this only worked for thing outside of Docker).
- Brane-job causing the Docker engine to connect to '127.0.0.1:5000/127.0.0.1:5000'; removed one of the two hostnames (specifically, the one in brane-job itself).
- Network 'kind' not being found; changed it to 'brane' in the default infra.yml, as this is also the network name used in the Docker Compose files.
- The type of an Array not being resolved properly, causing to error down the line due to incompatible types (while they in fact are).
- VM crashing whenever the job returned no output.

## [0.4.1] - 2021-08-16
### Fixed
- Disable debug logging from within WaitUntil future.
- Always use offset of at least 1 for nested call frames.
- Uniformly handle local and remote jobs.
- Propagate debug, stdout, and stderr output from driver to client.
- Construct package index from graphql endpoint.
- Missing scylla address in docker-compose-brn.yml

## [0.4.0] - 2021-08-11
### Added
- BraneScript, an alternative to Bakery with more a C-like syntax.
- GraphQL endpoint for querying application event logs, including subscriptions.
- Initial support for proxies and bridge functions: `brane-net`.
- Allow checkout folder name to be different than 'brane' (by [romnn](https://github.com/romnn)).
- Automated (daily) audits and multi-platform builds using GitHub actions.
- Optional flag to keep temporary package build files.
- Automatically add `token` and `server` arguments for OAS functions. 

### Changed
- Use seperate service for scheduling functions: `brane-job`.
- Use seperate library for OpenAPI support: `brane-oas`.
- REPL is now based on the `rustyline` library.
- Use gRPC for drivers (REPL and Jupyter kernel).
- Switched from Cassandra to ScyllaDB, and removed PostgreSQL dependency.
- DSL implementation is based on parser combinatorics, with `nom`.
- Switched from `actix` to `warp` as the framework for `brane-api`.

### Fixed
- Minor fixes for the word count quickstart.
- Correctly convert between DSL values and specification values.

## [0.3.0] - 2021-03-03
### Added
- Generate convenience function for CWL workflows with a single required parameter.
- `run` command to run DSL script from files. 
- `import` command to import packages from a GitHub repository.
- JupyterLab-based registry viewer.

## Changed
- The `import` DSL statement accepts multiple packages on the same line.
- Optional properties do not have to be specified while creating an object in the DSL.
- Cell output shows progress indicator and has time statistics.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-12-15
### Added
- Contributing guide, code of conduct, and issue templates (bug & feature).
- LOFAR demonstration
- Session attach/detach mechanism in JupyterLab.
- Custom renderers in JupyterLab.

### Changed
- Docker, HPC (Xenon), and Kubernetes runners are now configurable.
- Removing a package also removes it locally from Docker.
- CWL packages are now also locally testable.

### Fixed
- Various bug fixes and improvements.
- Allow pointers when creating arrays and objects in Bakery.

## [0.1.0] - 2020-06-04
### Added
- Initial implementation.
