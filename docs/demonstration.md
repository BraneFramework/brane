# Demonstration
In this two-part screencast, Brane is used to develop a workflow based on the [LOFAR](http://lofar.org) project. The first video demonstrates how packages are created. The second video, in turn, shows how these packages are used as workflow building blocks. All the code is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/onnovalkering/brane/tree/master/examples/lofar) and [here](https://github.com/EOSC-LOFAR/prefactor-cwl).
