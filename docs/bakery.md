# Bakery
...


The syntax of a function call is specified by the author of the target function. The author specifies a pattern using a pre-/in-/postfix notation. The same pattern can be used by different functions as long as the arguments have different types, i.e. overloading. This syntax mechanism substantiates the sentence-like statements, and allows Bakery to be customized towards domain-specific jargon.
