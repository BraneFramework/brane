# CONTAINER.yml
#   by Tim MÃ¼ller
#
# This file implements a package that provides a "data sink" function that simply takes a dataset and passes it, without any preprocessing.
# 
# This is used to test data transfers, among other things.
#


# Define the file metadata
name: data_sink
version: 1.0.0
kind: ecu

# Specify the files that are part of the package. All entries will be resolved to relative to the container.yml file (by default)
files:
- data_sink.sh

# Define the entrypoint: i.e., which file to call when the package function(s) are run
entrypoint:
  kind: task
  exec: data_sink.sh

# Define the functions in this package
actions:
  'data_sink':
    # It takes the local dataset
    input:
    - type: Data
      name: input
    # It outputs the same thing but now as an intermediate result

    - type: IntermediateResult
