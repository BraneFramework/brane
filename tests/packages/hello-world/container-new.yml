# This file implements the first tutorial in the Brane: The User Guide book.

#
# Specifically, it defines a simple package that always returns 'Hello, world!'.
#


# Define the file metadata
name: hello_world
version: 1.0.0

# Define the conceptual functions in this package
functions:
  # We only have one: the 'hello_world()' function
  hello_world:
    # We define the output: a string, which will be read from the return YAML under the 'output' key.
    output:
      message:
        type: string

# Now we implement those functions
# The `!Ecu` defines this package is a container
implementation: !ecu
  # We define the command to run. Every entry in this 
  entrypoint: !file
    "hello_world.sh"
