# CONTAINER.yml
#   by Tim MÃ¼ller
#
# This file implements a test for interacting with a CUDA backend.
#


# Define the file metadata
# Note the 'kind', which defines that it is an Executable Code Unit (i.e., runs arbitrary code)
name: cuda
version: 1.0.0
kind: ecu

# Specify the files that are part of the package. All entries will be resolved to relative to the container.yml file (by default)
files:
- smi.sh

# Define the entrypoint: i.e., which file to call when the package function(s) are run
entrypoint:
  kind: task
  exec: smi.sh

# Install NVIDIA
dependencies:
- nvidia-utils-525

# Define the functions in this package
actions:
  # We only have one: the 'hello_world()' function
  'nvidia_smi':
    # No special arguments needed to pass to the script
    command:
    # No input needed
    input:
    # We define the output: a string string, which will be read from the return YAML under the 'output' key.
    output:
    - type: string
      name: output
    # The important bit: we need a GPU for this function
    requirements:
    - cuda_gpu
