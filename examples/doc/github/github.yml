# Specifically, it defines an API call to the Github API to get the contents of
# a README.md file of a given repository.
#


# Because this document follows the OpenAPI specification, check: https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.0

# We set some metadata: the version of OpenAPI and the name & version (which will be directly translated to the Brane package name & version)
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: GitHub
  version: 1.0.0

# Defines the server(s) to perform the API calls to
servers:
- url: https://api.github.com

# Defines the API & HTTP methods pairs that define functions
paths:
  '/repos/{owner}/{repo}/readme':
    get:
      # The operation ID will be the function name
      operationId: getreadme
      # Very similar to Brane function definitions!
