# This file implements the second tutorial in the Brane: The User Guide book.

#        engineers/base64.html
#
# Specifically, it defines a simple package that can encode/decode Base64
# strings.
#


# Define the file metadata
name: base64
version: 1.0.0
kind: ecu

# Define the files that are part of the package
files:
- code.py

# Defines the file to call whenever a function is called
entrypoint:
  kind: task
  exec: code.py

# Define the dependencies (as Ubuntu packages)
dependencies:
- python3
- python3-yaml

# Define the actions
actions:
  encode:
    command:
      # This is just a list of arguments we pass to the function (i.e., sys.argv in Python)
      args:
      - encode
    input:
    # Define the input: a single string under the 'INPUT' environment variable
    - name: input
      type: string
    output:
    # Define the output: a string, identifyable by the 'output' key
    - name: output
      type: string

  decode:
    command:
      args:
      - decode
    input:
    # Define the input: a single string under the 'INPUT' environment variable
    - name: input
      type: string
    output:
    # Define the output: a string, identifyable by the 'output' key
    - name: output
      type: string
